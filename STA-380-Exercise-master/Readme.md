This repository showcases some of the work that I did as part of the Predictive Modelling Course at UT Austin's MSBA Program.

These 6 mini-projects are implemented in R-markdown and cover a wide range of topics such as Visual Story Telling through Exploratory Data Analysis, Portfolio Modelling, Market Segmentation, Association Rule Mining and Prediction of Author Attribution through text mining.

### Visual story telling part 1: green buildings
This project contains a detailed exploratory analysis of green building to analyse if a green building is financially more feasible than a non-green building

### Visual story telling part 2: flights at ABIA
This project contains a detailed exploratory analysis of flight data at the Austin ABIA Airport and derives interesting findings for the same 

### Portfolio modeling
In this project we will construct three different portfolios of exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, and use bootstrap resampling to analyze the short-term tail risk of your portfolios

### Market segmentation
In this project, we try to analyze our data and cluster it based on the customers online activity so that our client can approach the market in a more segmented fashion

### Author attribution
In this project we built a model, using different tools, for predicting the author of an article on the basis of that article's textual content

### Association rule mining
Using the data available for grocery purchases we tried to derive some interesting association rules for different shopping baskets
