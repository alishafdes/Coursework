This repository showcases some of the work that I did as part of the Predictive Modelling Course at UT Austin's MSBA Program.

These 6 mini-projects are implemented in R-markdown and cover a wide range of topics such as Visual Story Telling through Exploratory Data Analysis, Portfolio Modelling, Market Segmentation, Association Rule Mining and Prediction of Author Attribution through text mining.
