The New York Times (NYT) has a large reader base and plays an important role in shaping public opinion and setting the tone of the public discourse, especially in the U.S. The objective of this project was to understand the influence of NYT reviews on restaurant perceptions.

We have scraped Yelp reviews and performed sentiment analysis on the reviews using the VADER package in python to analyse the change in sentiment before and after the review was published. We also performed topic modelling using LDA.
