This folder contains all the mini-projects and assignments that was part of my coursework at UT Austin's MSBA Program.

There are two parts to this folder, one is implemented in R (R Markdown) and the other is implemented in Python (Jupyter Notebook).

Each folder will have its own ReadME file that will tell you more about what I have done. Each folder has the visuals and data for the corresponding notebooks.
