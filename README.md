This folder contains all the mini-projects and assignments that was part of my coursework at UT Austin's MSBA Program.

Though most of the projects are implemented in Python (Jupyter notebook), few are implemented in R (R markdown) as well.

Each folder will have its own ReadME file that will tell you more about what I have done. Each folder has the visuals and data for the corresponding notebooks.
